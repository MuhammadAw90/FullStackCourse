          The Persian cat (Persian: گربه پارسی, romanized: Gorbe'-ye Pârsi),
          also known as the Persian longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat
          characterized by a round face and short muzzle. The first documented
          ancestors of Persian cats were imported into Italy from Persia around
          1620.[1][2] Widely recognized by cat fancy since the late 19th
          century, Persian cats were first adopted by the British, and later by
          American breeders after World War II. Some cat fancier organizations'
          breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants
          of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds.

          The sea otter is an aquatic member of the weasel family found along
          the coasts of the Pacific Ocean in North America and Asia. Sea otters
          often float on their backs at the water's surface.
