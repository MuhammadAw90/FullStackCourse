      <h1>Meet Narwhal, the rescued 'unicor' puppy with a tail on his face</h1>

          <em>Norwhal<sup>1</sup> is by many measures a normal puppy. Caregivers say he likes
          to nibble on fingers and give kisses and wnats to play with anyone
          nearby.</strong>On the other hand, he also has a second tail sprouting from his forehead — an appendage that's prompted the nickname “unicorn puppy” and captivated dog lovers in the days since a Missouri rescue group brought him in from the side of a road.</em>

      <p>“We are so stupid excited about it,” said Rochelle Steffen, who founded the Jackson, Mo.-based organization that's caring for Narwhal.

        Steffen's group, <a href="https://www.iampitbullstrong.com//">Mac's Mission</a>, focuses on <s>unicorn</s> “special needs” dogs that require extra medical care due to birth defects, injuries or abuse. Staff see horrific cases of pets who’ve been shot, run over or abandoned, Steffen told The Washington Post. They rescue animals that might get euthanized elsewhere and then help them find permanent homes.<p>
